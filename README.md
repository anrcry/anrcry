# Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"/>


I am Anweshan Roy Chowdhury, short Anweshan (often called doraemon, I believe for my somewhat round face), alias @formula21.

I am a student residing in India, and currently studying my **Master of Science** degree in Computer Science from the University of Calcutta (wish me luck). I graduated with my **Bachelor of Science** degree in Computer Science, from the University of Calcutta. I passed my ISC and ICSE Examinations from La Martiniere for Boys (Calcutta, India). My interests in Computer Science really started with its introduction in Class 3 or 4, with a language called LOGO. It grew to several other languages. I can now boast myself of knowing & really liking Python (I love & admire the language) and JavaScript. At the server-side, besides using PHP, I have used (or come across) Node.js (which is the really the future). Apart from this, I love to binge watch any series or movies on any OTT platform. I love to feed myself with different food (current favourite: Pizza). I have a hobby of reciting poems, playing my synthesizer, and having a chat with my grandmother. Apart from that, I really feel myself blessed when I have a quite & undisturbed sleep.
