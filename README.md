My name is Anweshan Roy Chowdhury (aka @anrcry). I am current working as a Full Stack Developer at [Pravaah Consulting](https://www.pravaahconsulting.com/), while studying & pursuing **Master of Science in Computer Science** from the University of Calcutta. I received an **A** letter grade and a **Bachelor of Science (Honors) Degree** from the same university in 2021. I completed my schooling at La Martiniere for Boys, earning the best scores in Computer Science for both my I.S.C. and I.C.S.E.

You may have guessed that **I enjoy coding**. My major areas of interest include _artificial intelligence, backend development, UI/UX development_. I also enjoy bridging the gap between old and modern programming languages.

Over these years, I have learned multiple programming languages. The ones I love personally and use professionally is JavaScript (Front-End & Back-End) \[Recommended with TypeScript 🤩\], Flutter & Python and sometimes PHP among others. I am extremely familiar with ReactJS, moderately with VueJS and AngularJS. I often use ViteJS among other build tools in most projects. I actively develop backend with Node.js and Python, truely bringing the Full Stack Experience. Among these, I am also quite familiar with Laravel Framework. My database flavour would always be NoSQL to SQL. So I would give [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) Product of Century 🏆 award. This is one of my most used Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) accross all projects. I also use firebase to host my sites once they are completed. However other databases like PostgresSQL & MySQL are also loved.

Aside from programming, I enjoy playing my synthesizer, listening to music, binge-watching fascinating shows, and eating a lot of excellent (or perhaps amazing) food (very often, without a reason).
