## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Anweshan Roy Chowdhury, short Anweshan (often called doraemon, I believe for my somewhat round face), alias @formula21.

I am a student residing in India, and currently studing (or rather finishing) my **Bachelor of Science** degree in Computer Science. I passed my ISC and ICSE Examinations from La Martinere for Boys (Calcutta, India). My interests in Computer Science really started with its introduction in Class 3 or 4, with a language called LOGO. In grew to Q-BASIC, JAVA & Adv. JAVA (my 2nd preference), C/C++/C#, Python (my preference). As for server-side programming I have been exposed to PHP & Node.js. I quite like Javascript as a language. Besides coding, I love eating (a lot!!), watching cricket, finding bugs (in codes, others work, respositories), reading books (well this is a lie), making PDF's (seriously added for fun ðŸ¤£), watching comedy (good comedy), and some detective films (in any language which I know).
