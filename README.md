# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Anweshan Roy Chowdhury, short Anweshan (often called doraemon, I believe for my somewhat round face), alias @formula21.

I am a student residing in India, and currently studing (or rather finishing) my **Bachelor of Science** degree in Computer Science. I passed my ISC and ICSE Examinations from La Martinere for Boys (Calcutta, India). My interests in Computer Science really started with its introduction in Class 3 or 4, with a language called LOGO. It grew to several other languages. I can now boast myself of knowing & really liking Python (I love & admire the language) and Javascript. At the server-side, besides using PHP, I have used (or come accross) Node.js (which is the really the future).
