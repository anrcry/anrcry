My name is Anweshan Roy Chowdhury (aka @anrcry). I am a student that enjoys studying computer science as my primary subject. I am now pursuing **Master of Science in Computer Science** at the University of Calcutta. I received an **A** letter grade and a **Bachelor of Science (Honors) Degree** from the same university in 2021. I completed my schooling at La Martiniere for Boys, earning the best scores in Computer Science for both my I.S.C. and I.C.S.E.

You may have guessed that **I enjoy coding**. My major areas of interest include _artificial intelligence, backend development, UI/UX development_. I also enjoy bridging the gap between old and modern programming languages.

I've learned a number of programming languages throughout the years, some as part of my academic pursuits and others simply out of interest. Python is one of my favourite programming languages. The most current programming languages I learnt are the popular JS Frameworks such as Node.js, React.js, and Express, to mention a few. I've also started the switch from RESTful API to GraphQL API and rapidly adapting to changes wherever possible. However, this does not indicate that I am unfamiliar with PHP, MySQL, or Java. I feel that when these languages are combined with modern languages, they provide some of the greatest outcomes. Recently, I've started merging PHP and Laravel projects with Node.js libraries. One example is using 'socket.io' to track changes to a file and provide users with real-time notifications and UI modifications.

Aside from programming, I enjoy playing my synthesizer, listening to music, binge-watching fascinating shows, and eating a lot of excellent (or perhaps amazing) food (very often, without a reason).
